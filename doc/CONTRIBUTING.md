# Contributing to Snoopy development

[![Flattr Snoopy Logger project](http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=a2o&url=https://github.com/a2o/snoopy&title=Snoopy Logger)

New ideas are welcome. Most of change requests so far were about additional
log data or filtering capabilities, therefore most of development/changes
is expected in that area.

## Git branches

The following git branches are persist in main Snoopy repository:

- master: contains latest Snoopy development efforts. All new features
    snould be based on this branch.
- stable: present when master branch has sufficiently drifted from latest
    stable release, but is still far away from becoming stable. Used
    for quick bugfixes and stable release maintenance.
- install: branch dedicated to Snoopy automated install procedure. When
    you use it, install-snoopy.sh script is downloaded from this
    branch.
- coverity_scan: when Coverity analysis of a build is required, it is
    performed using this branch. Usually it lazily follows master
    branch. Coverity has a limited build submission frequency, thus
    a dedicated branch has been created to trigger analysis on
    an-needed basis.
- legacy: orphaned branch, which contains imported Snoopy releases from
    1.00 to 1.6.1 + changes to bring it in sync with initial commit
    from master branch. This is a lousy attempt to recreate lost
    SVN history (commits 1-31). Present for historical completeness
    only.


The following branches are transient branches, usually found in contributor's

Snoopy repo clones:
- bugfix/*:        pull request branch, contains one bugfix,
- documentation/*: pull request branch, contains documentation work,
- enhancement/*:   pull request branch, contains one enhancement (not a new feature, but improvement nonetheless)
- feature/*:       pull request branch, contains a new feature,
- refactoring/*:   pull request branch, contains code refactoring,


### On what branch should you base your contribution to Snoopy?

**As a general rule, base your contribution on MASTER branch.**

Exception:
- you found a bug that impacts current stable release - base your work on
    **stable** branch, if it is currently present in Snoopy repo. Maintainer
    will merge it into master branch.

Non-exception:
- you have developed a new feature and would like it to land in the next bugfix
    release: **do not bother**. Bugfix releases are bugfix releases, they are
    not intended to introduce new features. Base your work on **master** branch.
    If you somehow manage to convince maintainer(s) that your feature should
    land in next bugfix release anyway, maintainer will do the integration.



## Data source development

- data sources are located in src/datasource/;
- data source names should be lower case, with underscores for word separation;
- data about currently executing process is available in src/inputdatastorage.*
    files. Consult existing data sources on how to use it (filename for example);
- each data source must be self-sufficient. Do not rely on other parts of Snoopy;
- each data source must be tidy (free all mallocs, close all file descriptors);
- the first argument passed to each provider is a char array to return message into;
- data source message must not be longer than SNOOPY_DATASOURCE_MESSAGE_MAX_SIZE;
- each data source must have a corresponding header file;
- all data sources must build with -Wall -Werror flags (enabled by default);
- code indentation: 4 spaces, no tabs;
- reserverd data source names:
    - snoopy*

If you have developed a shiny new data source and you would like to start using
it with Snoopy, you have to add it to the following files to make Snoopy fully
aware of it:

- src/datasource/NAME.h        (your data source's main header file)
- src/datasource/NAME.c        (your data source's main source code goes here)
- src/datasource/Makefile.am   (one reference)
- src/datasourceregistry.c     (three references - header, name and function name)
- configure.ac                 (one reference)
- config.h.in                  (one reference, autogenerated by ./bootstrap.sh)
- etc/snoopy.ini.in            (one reference in comments, for documentation purposes)
- ChangeLog                    (short description of new feature)


## Filter development rules

Rules for filter development are the same as for new data source development,
with the following additional specifics:

- filters are located in src/filter/;
- each filter is passed two arguments:
    - logMessage and
    - filter argument (if any, otherwise an empty string is passed);
- filter argument is literal. If it contains multiple arguments (separated by
    comma, for example), the filter itself must do the parsing/tokenization.
- filter MAY modify logMessage. If it does so, the new log message MUST NOT
    EXCEED the maximum log message size, defined in snoopy.h.
- filter MUST return SNOOPY_FILTER_PASS or SNOOPY_FILTER_DROP constant;
- if SNOOPY_FILTER_DROP is returned by filter, it causes immediate termination
    of filter chain processing and message is not logged to syslog;
- reserved filter names:
    - snoopy*

If you have developed a shiny new filter and you would like to start using
it with Snoopy, you have to add it to the following files to make Snoopy fully
aware of it:

- src/filter/NAME.h            (your filter's main header file)
- src/filter/NAME.c            (your filter's main source code goes here)
- src/filter/Makefile.am       (one reference)
- src/filterregistry.c         (three references - header, name and function name)
- configure.ac                 (one reference)
- config.h.in                  (one reference, autogenerated by ./bootstrap.sh)
- etc/snoopy.ini.in            (one reference in comments, for documentation purposes)
- ChangeLog                    (short description of new feature)



## Output development rules

Rules for new output development are the same as for new filter development,
with the following additional specifics:

- outputs are located in src/output/;
- as output names are generally very generic, files and functions are suffixed with "...output";
- each output is passed three arguments:
    - logMessage
    - flag whether logMessage is a regular Snoopy log message or an error message
    - output argument string (might not be used by output)
- output argument is literal. If it contains multiple arguments (separated by
    comma, for example), the output itself must do the parsing/tokenization.
- reserved output names:
    - snoopy*

If you have developed a shiny new output and you would like to start using
it with Snoopy, you have to add it to the following files to make Snoopy fully
aware of it:

- src/output/NAME.h            (your output's main header file)
- src/output/NAME.c            (your output's main source code goes here)
- src/output/Makefile.am       (one reference)
- src/outputregistry.c         (three references - header, name and function name)
- configure.ac                 (one reference)
- config.h.in                  (one reference, autogenerated by ./bootstrap.sh)
- etc/snoopy.ini.in            (one reference in comments, for documentation purposes)
- ChangeLog                    (short description of new feature)



## Creating feature documentation

Here is a brief description of Snoopy documentation structure.

File /README.md:
- general information and quick install instructions;

Directory /doc/:
- documentation which is useful to average Snoopy user;
- /doc/INSTALL.md: detailed installation instructions;
- /doc/FAQ.md: location of answers to frequently asked questions;

- /doc/DATA-SOURCES.md: general, data-sources-specific information;
- /doc/DATA-SOURCE_complex_data_source_name.md: documentation for advanced
    and configurable data source called "complex_data_source_name", which
    has its code located in src/datasource/complex_data_source_name.c;
    (also, do not include "_name" suffix in data source's name:);

- /doc/FILTERING.md: filtering-specific information;
- /doc/FILTER_complex_filter_name.md: documentation for advanced filter called
    "complex_filter_name", which has its code located in
    src/filter/complex_filter_name.c;

Directory /doc/internals/:
- location of documetation useful to Snoopy developers and contributors;
- /doc/internals/README.md: main document about Snoopy internals



## Creating pull requests for upstream merges

Commits:
- your commits should be easily readable, with concise comments;
- your commits should follow the KISS principle: do one thing, and do it well.

Branching:
- see section about branches above.
- branch your contribution branch from Snoopy's master branch;
- branch name: feature/my-shiny-new-snoopy-feature-title for new features;
- branch name: bugfix/my-totally-non-hackish-workaround for bugfixes;
- branch name: master (avoiding creating dedicated branch) may only be used for trivial fixes.

Pull requests:
- do not create pull requests from master branch;
- one pull request should contain one change only
    (one bugfix or one feature at a time);
- if you have developed multiple features and/or bugfixes, create separate
    branches for each one of them, and request merges for each branch;
- Snoopy uses Travis-CI for testing builds. When you submit a pull request,
    wait for Travis-CI to finish the build and see if everything went
    smoothly.
- the cleaner you code/change/changeset is,
    the faster it will be merged.
- Coverity scan is run on as-needed basis, but keep in mind that you might be
    "called to court:)" - contacted to defend your contribution should Coverity
    point out some defects in your code.

That is it. Happy coding! :)
