Due to unfortunate source code repository conversion from subversion to git,
original 31 commits that existed in SVN are lost.

Trying to make up for it we are creating this orphaned branch called 'legacy'
and importing all relevant Snoopy releases into it (from 1.00 to 1.6.1) which
can still be found. Unfortunately despite my best googling efforts release
version 1.5.0 can not be found. This misfortune is a bit amended by the fact
that mentioned release was very faulty.

Maybe someday we will rebase master branch on this legacy branch, to get as
complete history as possible. Very maybe.
